#  Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India, using a linear regression model. We leverage the Bengaluru House Price Dataset available on Kaggle to train a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various features.


## Project Overview

House prices vary significantly based on factors like location, area, number of rooms, amenities, and more. Predicting housing prices is essential for both buyers and sellers to understand market trends and make informed decisions. This project demonstrates a simple linear regression approach to predict house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Bengaluru House Price dataset from Kaggle. It contains various attributes such as:

#### Location: The area or locality of the house

#### Size: Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

#### Total Square Feet: The total area in square feet

#### Price per Square Feet: Price per unit area

#### Availability: Availability status of the house (e.g., immediate, ready-to-move, etc.)

#### This dataset provides the necessary data to train and evaluate a model for predicting house prices.


# Project Workflow

## 1.Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature selection to select the most impactful variables for the model.

## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualization and analysis of various features.
Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations among the features.
Model Training:

## 3. Implemented a Simple Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
Model training on the processed dataset, with target variable as house price.
Model Evaluation:

## 3. Model performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Getting Started

# Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset file (downloaded from Kaggle).
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebook files for EDA, model training, and testing.
src/: Contains Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
README.md: Project documentation.

# Results
Model Performance: The model achieved an MAE of [insert MAE value] and an RMSE of [insert RMSE value] on the test dataset.
Insights: Visualized key features impacting house prices, like location and area, which showed significant influence on the price predictions.
Future Work
Experiment with other regression algorithms, such as multiple linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to improve model performance.
Include hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model further.
Visualize price predictions on a map to gain geographic insights into price distributions.
